# HashTable-Collisions

This is an academic assignment for Data structues and Algorithms ||

It is a program for filling and retrieving data (in this case Strings) from a HashTable using linear probing to lessen the collision count.

When tested with an array of 90,000 strings the collision count was approximately 650,000
